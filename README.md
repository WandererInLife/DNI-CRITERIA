# DNI-CRITERIA

If you happen to fit into any of these categories, dni.

────୨ৎ────

ᛝ<⚡︎𝟑ᛝ PEDOPHILES - If you happen to be a PEDOPHILE (A person attracted to minors) do NOT interact with me. I have no respect for you and if you try anything with me, don't. I don't care if you happen to be one of my closest friends, I will block you.

ᛝ<⚡︎𝟑ᛝ HOMOPHOBICS - You can not support the lgbtq due to religion, that's fine, but if you continously harass these people dni.

ᛝ<⚡︎𝟑ᛝ SEXISTS - Stop judging off of genders with your little stereotypes, this is for men and women and any in-between.

ᛝ<⚡︎𝟑ᛝ ZOOPHILES - Being attracted to animals is not normal, please get help.

ᛝ<⚡︎𝟑ᛝ PROBLEMATIC PEOPLE - If you were once a problematic person but changed, you can INT. But if you happen to still be problematic please DNI. I don't like getting roped into drama.

ᛝ<⚡︎𝟑ᛝ HARASSERS/TROLLS - I cannot express how much hatred I have for these types of players. Do not come up to my friends or I and harass us for no reason. It's annoying and what do you even gain from it?

ᛝ<⚡︎𝟑ᛝ PEOPLE WHO CAN'T TAKE **NO** - No means NO. I don't want to discuss about a certain topic or I don't want you to go bashing someone because I'm upset with them. I don't want to do it and I'm not going to.

₊✩‧₊˚౨ৎ˚₊✩‧₊

Any other sort of problematic people, dni. If you're a close friend of mine and I find out you're any one of these, I will confront you about it and try to get things sorted out. If that goes nowhere, I might block you.
